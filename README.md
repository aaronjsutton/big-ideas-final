## Collaboration Strategy
Choose one (or more, if we need) datasets to work with and then compile a notebook that does data
analysis pertaining to the "bestness" of a neighborhood. Work on files individually, then at the end
we can compile the data into one final "presentation" notebook.

**Presentation date: April 15-16**
