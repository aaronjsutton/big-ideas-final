# Big Ideas Final Project
_Best neighborhood in the 'burgh... n'at._

## Authors
- [Aaron Sutton](https://github.com/aaronjsutton)
- [Daniel Evans](https://github.com/evansd28)
- [Diego Jurado](https://github.com/juradodiego)

## Datasets
- Aaron: Traffic Data and Car Crash Data
- Daniel:
- Diego: Fire Incidents and Response Time
  The dataset records every fire-related incident in Pittsburgh, and correspond it to an address, fire zone, and incident type.
  These classifiers will be used to separate each neighborhood/fire zone and quantify the types of incidents that occur and their response time.
  Ultimately these will be used to create a ranking, the neighborhood with the ranking closest to 1 shall be declared the best.

## Collaboration Strategy
Choose one (or more, if we need) datasets to work with and then compile a notebook that does data
analysis pertaining to the "bestness" of a neighborhood. Work on files individually, then at the end
we can compile the data into one final "presentation" notebook.

### Git Workflow
Since we are all collaborators working on individual files, we should not have to worry about merge issues.
Best practice though, is to work on our own branches, make commits, then PR into master. No need for forks,
and we can all merge our own PRs. Only thing to **never** do is force push... i.e. `git push -f`.
