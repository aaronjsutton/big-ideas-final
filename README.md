## Getting Startedâ„¢

1. In Canvas (canvas.pitt.edu), click on this class, CMPINF0010
2. Go to Modules
5. Click `Skills Lab Final Project` and click `Link to the Final Project on JupyterHub`
6. JupyterHub should open up to this week's materials!


## If Pulse Secure doesn't work for you

Use Pitt IT's [Virtual Lab](https://www.technology.pitt.edu/services/virtual-lab). I recommend using the Web Client as listed on that website. You can download and submit files to Canvas directly from the virtual lab instance. However, if you need to get files to your local machine, you should use **OneDrive**, since it it already set up on the machine. You can then download your files to your local machine from [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/signin/).


### If JupyterLab _still_ doesn't work for you

Use Binder:

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to your computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.
